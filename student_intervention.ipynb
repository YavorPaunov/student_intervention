The specific case described in the article is a bone marrow harvest simulator. The classifier is trained by experts who execute a task several times with three different levels of performance. It is based on features related to the user's interaction with the simulator. Later, when users perform the task their performance is classified into one of the three performance levels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Strengths_\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes can predict accurately with even small amounts of data.\n",
    "It is fast and has a low memory footprint.It can predict accurately even with small amounts of training data. If the data is enough for the model to pick up the probabilities associated with each feature then it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage, although irrelevant to the student intervention problem, is that it can be used for multiclass classification \"out of the box\".\n",
    "\n",
    "_Weaknesses_\n",

    "Assumes each feature contributes to the prediction independently. In cases where this assumption does not hold the classifier's performance may be affected negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Problem fit_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my choice of a fast, simple classifier. The deciding was between this and Logistic Regression. In the end I chose Naive Bayes because of the low amount of training data in relation to the number features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "_Real-world application_\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM were used in [predicting whether companies will go bankrupt](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Young-Chan_Lee/publication/222580945_Bankruptcy_prediction_using_support_vector_machine_with_optimal_choice_of_kernel_function_parameters/links/02e7e52bac4f202c28000000.pdf) based on past financial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Strengths_\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM are quite flexible. Depending on the choice of kernel function it can model both linear and non-linear data. Choosing the linear kernel function is faster (both in training and prediction), however if the data is not linearly separable will result in lower accuracy. On the other hand, choosing a more complex kernel function, like RBF, is slower but can model non-linearly separable data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Weaknesses_\n",
    "\n",
    "Something thing to keep in mind is that using RBF can lead to overfitting in case the amount of training data is too low. This can be controlled using a regularization parameter. Also, SVM tend to be quite sensitive to missing values in the training data. \n",

    "AdaBoost is widely used in computer vision. One example is the [the Viola-Jones object detection framework](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf) which is based on AdaBoost. Viola-Jones uses a so called cascade architecture in which a number of different classifiers are trained using different features. When predicting a data point the algorithm goes through each of the classifiers and the final predicted value is positive only if all classifiers say so. If any of the classifiers predict a negative value, then the point is immediately classified as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_Strengths_\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of using AdaBoost is that it requires no parameter tweaking, it works well \"out of the box\". However, an appropriate weak learner still needs to be selected. Tree stumps (1-level trees) are a common choise that usually works well.\n",
    "Another advantage is that given a good choice of weak classifiers and lack of noise in the data overfitting tends not to be a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Weaknesses_\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, AdaBoost tends to overfit on noisy data since strongly misclassified data points are penalized harshly. It also overfits if the weak classifiers are too complex (e.g. letting a decision tree grow to much). Another thing to consider is that the model it generates can have a large memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Problem fit_\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "Support vector machines work by creating a dividing line between the two classes of data. Imagine each student being represented by a point on a 2D graph. During training SVM tries to find the line that best separates the students who pass from those who fail. That is, the line that is furthest from any of the points for each of the classes. It might not always be possible to separate the data with a straight line. In that case, given the SVM is configured correctly, it will try to draw a curve as a separator instead while again keeping the distance to the two classes as high as possible. The final result is a graph divided in two. \n",
